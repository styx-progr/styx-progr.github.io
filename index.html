      <p>This website is for me to learn some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
      <p>
        What do I want to do? <br>
        I want to create two major things at the moment:
        <u>
          <li>A pixel art where any user can draw on.</li>
          <li>A family tree type where entries can be made for each member. 
            This I want to do, because it would be nice to have some informations 
            about family members from previous generations.
          </li>
        </u>

      <p>Hi and welcome to my homepage :D</p>
      <h2>What's it about?</h2>
      <p>I just created this website to learn some html, css and maybe javascript (did not need it so far).</p>
      <p>
        For the first project I want to implement a pixel art, on which each user can draw on (same to r/place).
      </p>
      <p>
        Also with the family tree I wanted to create an application that makes it possible to create entries and search through 
        the tree. For the login I wanted to apply some concepts of cryptography so the saved data is also secure.
