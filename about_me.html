      <h2>What have I done so far?</h2>
      <p class="info_text">
        Born on 16.08.1996 in Regensburg I started going to 'Grundschule Pr√ºfening' in 2003. From 2007 until 2015 I went to 'Privat-Gymnasium PINDL'. Then I started 
        studying the same year at the university Regensburg doing my bachelor's degree in biology. For my bachelor's thesis "Third generation sequencing of two 
        <i>Leucanthemum</i> chloroplast genomes using Oxford Nanopore MinION" I sequenced two chloroplast genomes with the MinION. During this thesis I had to extract DNA,
        enrich it using PCR, and then purifying it prior to sequencing. After sequencing we assembled the chloroplast genomes with the standard bioinformatics tools 
        available. With a master's student doing the same workflow but using Illumina for sequencing, we also compared which method would be better, as this was a first try 
        to introduce these procedures to the chair (evolution and systematic of plants). This work contributed towards a 
        <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0226234">publication</a>. During this time I got help a few times from a bioinformatician 
        that worked at the same chair. As I saw him doing his "magic" I decided that I also want to study bioinformatics for my master's. <br> <br>
        With finishing my bachelor's in march of 2019 I immediately started my master's in april at the Friedrich Schiller university Jena to learn the "magic". So far I 
        haven't officialy finished my master's but I already handed in my thesis in march and just waiting for my certificate. For my thesis 
        "Predicting RNA modifications with logistic regression and random forests using summary statistics" as the title already says I trained classifiers using two 
        different methods: logistic regression and random forests (as an example of linear and non-linear classifiers). These classifiers were trained to predict RNA 
        modifications based on summary statistics that were calculated on the sequencing signal of a MinION. This was done as the "modifications" group of the chair 
        (RNA Bioinformatics & High-Throughput Analysis) wanted to know whether simpler models are already sufficient enough to predict modifications.

      <h3>Experience</h3>
      <p class="info_text">
        During my bachelor's I tutored students of lower semesters in three courses (1x "Zytologie und Anatomie der Pflanzen", 2x "Formenkenntnis und Systematik 
        von Pflanzen"). In these I guided the students through their practical course, answered all their questions regarding the course, and prepared them for 
        the exams at the end of each course.
      </p>
      <p class="info_text">
        I also worked for Dekra Arbeit GmbH in which I got deployed as a service worker for Mercedes-Benz Stern-Center Regensburg GmbH & Co. KG. This mostly contained 
        of the work of a receptionist with customer contact.

      <h3>Skills</h3>
      <p class="info_text">Gaming on a very hi...probably more like "useful" skills. For programming I came in contact with a few. My main programming language 
        is python with which I'm also the most comfortable with. During my bachelor's I had a 2 weeks course for C and C++, so I got a short insight. 
        In my master's I also learned Java and R. Each of them was required for one module with each having a final project. Now with creating this website 
        I'm learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br>
        As I mostly worked on Linux environments during my master's so I am comfortable with shell scripting using Bash, for which I also visited a course 
        during my master's. Also I learned how to use Latex, which I used for all major projects and also for my thesis. During a project and my thesis I also 
        used GitHub, for having all my scripts up-to-date.

      <h3>Languages</h3>
      <p class="info_text">I speak german as my mother tongue and english on an advanced level.</p>
